  <p>This is animation reel of exercises from 3D Animation class, made in Autodesk Maya. Some exercises include bouncing balls, walk and run cycles, and a short dance sequence. Animation principles learnt in class, such as anticipation, and squash and stretch, were applied to achieve the resulting work. My main takeaway from these exercises was understanding the importance to really observe and understand how things move, and only by doing this, can we make them look even more interesting with animation.</p>

  <p>This is my first 3D short for 3D Production class, also made in Autodesk Maya. It is about two friends coming face-to-face with a brewing storm, and how Mother Nature makes fun of them. Although there were difficulties creating this short, and not completed with the best artistic quality, I enjoyed myself during the process, learning for the first time how to create my own characters and animating them in Maya. It was truly a fun experience, and has since made me more interested in 3D animation.</p>
